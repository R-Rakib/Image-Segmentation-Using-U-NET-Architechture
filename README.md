# 🧩 Image Segmentation using U-Net Architecture

An **image segmentation project** implemented using the **U-Net deep learning architecture** to perform pixel-level classification.  
This model is designed to accurately segment objects or regions of interest from images.

## 📌 Project Overview

Image segmentation plays a crucial role in applications such as **medical imaging, satellite imagery, and industrial inspection**.  
This project uses the **U-Net architecture**, which is especially effective for segmentation tasks due to its encoder–decoder structure and skip connections.

## 🧠 U-Net Architecture

U-Net consists of:
- **Encoder (Contracting Path):** Captures context using convolution and pooling  
- **Decoder (Expanding Path):** Enables precise localization using upsampling  
- **Skip Connections:** Preserve spatial information by combining encoder and decoder features  

This design allows the model to perform **high-precision segmentation even with limited training data**.
